      <!--INTRODUCTION-->
      <h3>How to Build a Digital Portfolio</h3>
      <p>Because we are all design majors, we felt it would be useful to do some
				research about creating a portfolio. Having a strong portfolio is incredibly
				important for designers as that is an employer's first impression on your
				work, so we need to know what to put into a portfolio and how to make it look
				nice. Since this is so relevant to all of us, we decided to go for this as our
				final topic.</p>

      <!--WEBSITES-->
      <h3>Suggested Websites</h3>
      <p>Out of all the Portfolios we reviewed, there were 4 host sites that were the most common:</p>
      <li>Wix</li>
      <li>SquareSpace</li>
      <li>WordPress</li>
      <li>Readymag</li>
      <li>and Pixpa</li>
      <br>
      <p>We suggest that you look into these websites when you begin looking for a platform to host your digital portfolio!</p>

        <!--IMAGE ONE / GOOD EXAMPLE-->
        <div class="media mt-3">

  		    <div class="mediabody">
  		      <h4>& <small><i>By Pawel Nolbert</i></small></h4>
  		      <p>This image is a great example of simplicity, while still being very
  						detailed. The & has a lot of texture and vibrant colors, while the
  						background is more simplistic and geometric. There is nice contrast
  						and this will easily stand out among other pieces in a portfolio and
  						is easily readable if it is a smaller size or thumbnail.</p>
  						<br>
  						<button onclick="myFunction1()">Is this a good portfolio piece?</button>

  						<div id="myDIV1" style="display: none;">
  						Yes! This is a good example of something to include in a graphic designer's portfolio!

			    <div class="mediabody4" style="text-align: right;">
			      <h4>After Hours <small><i>By Sam Hewa</i></small></h4>
			      <p>This shows a strong sense of color, composition and the designer’s
							style is clear. Additionally, this  shows a good example of  the
							designer’s work being applied to real life, not just on a screen.</p>
							<br>
							<button onclick="myFunction2()">Is this a good portfolio piece?</button>

      			<h4>Graphic Design is My Passion <small><i>By Yungterra</i></small></h4>
      			<p>An iconic meme created in July 2014 by Tumblr user Yungterra. This meme
      				quickly rose to popularity amongst visual artists and graphic design firms,
      				who used it as a form of self-advertisement.</p>
      				<br>
      				<button onclick="myFunction3()">Is this a good portfolio piece?</button>

      				<div id="myDIV3" style="display: none;">

            <h4>Digital Sketches <small><i>By Enes Diriğ</i></small></h4>
            <p>An example of digital sketches created by Enes Diriğ using Procreate
              and Photoshop. Sketches are a good way to illustrate and capture an
              artist's creative process.</p>

              <button onclick="myFunction4()">Is this a good portfolio piece?</button>

              <div id="myDIV4" style="display: none;">
              No. Although creative sketches are important, this type of unfinished,
              unedited work doesn’t belong in a portfolio
              </div>
          </div>

  		      <h4>No Title <small><i>By Brandon Woelfel</i></small></h4>
  		      <p>This is a good example to include in a portfolio because it demonstrates
              an understanding of camera mechanics and is a technically solid photo.
              Additionally, Brandon shows he is competent with his editing and communicates
              his style nicely.</p>

 			      <p>In this photo, Jessica shows she understands how to take a technically
              good photo, she is shooting directly into the sun but the photo is still
              nicely exposed. The model is posed nicely and the color editing is solid.</p>

               No. This type of product shot needs to be developed more before it can be included in a portfolio.

			      <h4>Cityscape <small><i>By Thomas Radclyffe</i></small></h4>
			      <p>This is an amazing piece technically. The buildings are accurate to
              scale and the perspective is accurate. While this is more realistic
              and less conceptual, if you are able to draw something like this you
              should absolutely put it in your portfolio.</p>

      			<h4>Pen Portrait <small><i>By Arianna Nalbach</i></small></h4>
      			<p>This would not be good to put in a portfolio as it is just a simple
              sketch and the photo of it isn’t great. The pen is covering part of
              the sketch, it wasn’t taken in good lighting so the paper has a weird
              tint to it and there is a lot of blank space to the right of the
              illustration. When taking pictures of traditional art, it is better
              to scan or have good lighting for the photo.</p>

            <p>Julia Mann shows a clear understanding of how to use colored pencils
              and the illustration is nice. However, this would not be a good example
              to put in a portfolio in some cases because it is fanart. Depending on
              the studio or school you are submitting the portfolio to, something like
              this might be better to leave out.</p>

              <div id="myDIV12" style="display: none;">
              Yes, and No. Be aware of the audience that you are submitting your portfolio to before adding work
              like this to your portfolio.
